<!-- CLOUD CONCEPTS -->

## Cloud Concepts ‚òÅÔ∏è

### What is Cloud Computing?

The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
<br />

_Read more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)._

### What are the benefits of Cloud Computing?

<b> Agility </b>

- Access new resources within minutes!
  <br />

<b> Elasticity </b>

- No more guessing capactiy, the cloud will grow and shrink with your needs.
  <br />

<b> Cost Savings </b>

- The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
  <br />

<b> Deploy Globally in Minutes </b>

- Deploy applications to customers around the world quickly with LOW latency.

### Deployment Models

1. Cloud Based

- Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
- Design and build new applications in the cloud.

2. On-Premises (Private)

- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

3. Hybrid

- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

### Types of Cloud Computing

1. <b> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </b>
   <br/>
   Think of this as a foundation... you're just laying building blocks! üß±

   - First layer / Lowest Level
   - Computer, Network, Storage
   - Flexible
   - Users: Traditional IT, Government, Universities

2. <b> Platform as a Service (PaaS) </b>
   <br/>
   Need to run a python web app? Need to be able to support Node.js? No problem! Support within a click of a button. ‚úÖ

   - Second Layer
   - Removes management of underlying hardware
   - Macroscopic Planning
   - Users: Individuals, Developers, Small Startups

3. <b> Software as a Service (SaaS) </b>
   <br/>
   Want to get something done without worrying about the logistics of how to do it? Simply sign in and start on your task! üë©‚Äçüíª

   - Third Layer / Highest Level
   - Capabilities and Hardware are abstracted
   - End User Software (Marketing, Email Services, etc...)
   - Users: Non-technical Users, Office, Students

### Compute in the Cloud

<h3 align="center">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</h3>

Think of a server in a coffee shop. A customer makes a request (small cup of coffee) to the server. The server executes this request and delivers it to the customer (or client). Amazon EC2 is the server in this scenario.

### Global Infrastructure and the AWS Advantage

There are cloud centers all over the world... need to expand your user base to Ireland? No problem- just one click away.

There are often multiple cloud centers in a region (availability zones). This ensures there is always coverage in case of any issues.

Benefits of AWS

- Easy to Use
- Flexible
- Cost-Effective
  <br/>
  You only pay for what you USE!
- Reliable
  <br />
  Hardware is not your responsibility.
- Scalable and high-performance
  <br />
  Automate scalability- or get it in just a few clicks!
  <br />
  Get guarantees in network performance. Faster speeds!
- Secure
  <br />
  Physical building security to software updates... they have you covered.
